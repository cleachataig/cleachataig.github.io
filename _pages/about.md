I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at McGill University and Paris-Saclay University, jointly affiliated with the Quebec AI Institute ([Mila](https://mila.quebec/en)) and the International Laboratory on Learning Systems ([ILLS](https://reporter.mcgill.ca/international-lab-dedicated-to-artificial-intelligence-kicks-off-in-montreal/)). My supervisors are [Professor Golnoosh Farnadi](https://gfarnadi.github.io/) and [Professor Pablo Piantanida](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/pablo-piantanida/home). Previously, I completed a Master’s degree in Computer Science at McGill University and an Engineering degree from CentraleSupélec (Paris-Saclay University).

My research focuses on developing reliable and comprehensive evaluation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), with the goal of better understanding their capabilities, limitations, and real-world impact.
